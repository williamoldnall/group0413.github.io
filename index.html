<h1>Designer Babies</h1>


</ul><p>This mock-up site is intended to support your team project so you can take this as a set of files and as a starting point and adapt it to your preference. 
It is built on a W3C site tutorial so does not claim to be flash, but now has an image, [of a paper we wrote a while back on CSED4G (Computing Education for the Social Good)]</p>
<p> 	
Roles 
- Sonia: Focusing on History of Precision Medicine and how designer babies came alive. 
- William: Focusing on key advantages in the technology and research of designer babies. 
- Asif: Focusing on risk and disadvantages of Precision Medicine, primarily cons of Designer babies. </p>
